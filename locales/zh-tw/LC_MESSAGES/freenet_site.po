"censorship is a good thing in some circumstances. For example, in some\n"
"European countries propagating information deemed to be racist is illegal.\n"
"Governments seek to prevent people from advocating ideas which are deemed\n"
"damaging to society. There are two answers to this however. The first is that\n"
"you can't allow those in power to impose \"good\" censorship, without also\n"
"enabling them to impose \"bad\" censorship. To impose any form of censorship a\n"
"government must have the ability to monitor and thus restrict communication.\n"
"There are already criticisms that the anti-racism censorship in many European\n"
"countries is hampering legitimate historical analysis of events such as the\n"
"second world war.\n"
"\n"
"The second argument is that this \"good\" censorship is counter-productive even\n"
"when it does not leak into other areas. For example, it is generally more\n"
"effective when trying to persuade someone of something to present them with\n"
"the arguments against it, and then answer those arguments. Unfortunately,\n"
"preventing people from being aware of the often sophisticated arguments used\n"
"by racists, makes them vulnerable to those arguments when they do eventually\n"
"encounter them.\n"
"\n"
"Of course the first argument is the stronger one, and would still hold-true\n"
"even if you didn't accept the second. Basically, you either have censorship,\n"
"or you don't. There is no middle-ground."
msgstr "### 6\\. 有時審查制度不是必須的嗎？\n\n所有問題都不是非黑即白的，很多人都認為在某些情況下審查制度是個好東西。例如，在某些歐洲國家，傳播種族主義信息是違法的。政府尋求阻止此思想的宣揚，以免破壞社會。但對此行為有兩種爭論。首先，您不能確保當權者實施「好的”審查制度，而不實施「壞的”審查制度。要實施任何形式的審查制度，政府一定擁有監視和限制溝通的權力。在很多歐洲國家已經有對種族主義審查制度的批評，它阻止了合理的對曆史事件的分析（如第二次世界大戰）。\n\n第二種爭論是，即使「好的”審查制度沒有滲入其他領域，它仍然會起到反作用。例如，通常來說，將爭議擺在桌面，回答這些爭議，更容易說服某人。不幸的是，雖然阻止了人們了解種族主義分子的爭議，但當他們最終遇到這些爭論時，他們會變得更加脆弱。\n\n當然第一種爭論是最強的，即使您不接受第二種爭論，它也是正確的。根本上，要么存在審查制度，要么不存在。不存在中間的情況。"

"### 7\\. But why is anonymity necessary?\n"
"\n"
"You cannot have freedom of speech without the option to remain anonymous.\n"
"Most censorship is retrospective, it is generally much easier to curtail free\n"
"speech by punishing those who exercise it afterward, rather than preventing\n"
"them from doing it in the first place. The only way to prevent this is to\n"
"remain anonymous. It is a common misconception that you cannot trust\n"
"anonymous information. This is not necessarily true, using digital signatures\n"
"people can create a secure anonymous pseudonym which, in time, people can\n"
"learn to trust. Freenet incorporates a mechanism called \"subspaces\" to\n"
"facilitate this."
msgstr "### 7\\. 但是為何需要匿名？\n\n如果您無法匿名，您不可能擁有言論自由。大部分的審查是可追溯的。在發表言論后再懲罰相關人員，比在言論發表第一時間處理更容易。唯一可避免懲罰的方式就是保持匿名。有一個常見的誤解是，匿名信息不可信。這不一定是正確的。使用數字簽名，人們可以創建一個安全的筆名，他人可以去信任這個筆名。Freenet 引入了「子空間（Subspaces）”的機制來使之成為可能。"

"### 8\\. And what of copyright?\n"
"\n"
"Of course much of Freenet's publicity has centered around the issue of\n"
"copyright, and thus I will speak to it briefly. The core problem with\n"
"copyright is that enforcement of it requires monitoring of communications,\n"
"and you cannot be guaranteed free speech if someone is monitoring everything\n"
"you say. This is important, most people fail to see or address this point\n"
"when debating the issue of copyright, so let me make it clear:\n"
"\n"
"> *You cannot guarantee freedom of speech and enforce copyright law*\n"
"\n"
"It is for this reason that Freenet, a system designed to protect Freedom of\n"
"Speech, must prevent enforcement of copyright."
msgstr "### 8\\. 版權又將怎樣？\n\nFreenet 的很多媒體報道都關注它帶來的版權問題，因此我在這里簡單說一下。版權的核心問題在於，為了保護版權，就需要監視通訊。如果某人監視了您所說的一切，您的言論自由就無法保障。這非常重要，在人們爭論保護版權的問題時，往往忽略了這一點。因此，我再次強調：\n\n> *您無法在保證言論自由的同時實施版權法*\n\n這就是 Freenet——一個被設計為保護言論自由的系統——拒絕保護版權的原因。"

"### 9\\. But how will artists be rewarded for their work without copyright?\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, even if copyright were the only way that artists could be rewarded\n"
"for their work, then I would contend that freedom is more important than\n"
"having professional artists (those who claim that we would have no art do not\n"
"understand creativity: people will always create, it is a compulsion,\n"
"the only question is whether they can do it for a living).\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, it could be questioned whether copyright is effective even now. The\n"
"music industry is one of the most vocally opposed to enhancements in\n"
"communication technology, yet according to many of the artists who should be\n"
"rewarded by copyright, it is failing to do so. Rather it has allowed\n"
"middle-men to gain control over the mechanisms of distribution, to the\n"
"detriment of both artists and the public."
msgstr "### 9\\. 但若藝朮家的工作沒有版權，他們如何得到回報？\n\n首先，即使版權是藝朮家從其作品獲得回報的唯一方式，我主張自由比擁有專業藝朮家更重要（那些聲稱我們沒有藝朮細胞不懂得創新的人：人們總是在創新，這是種沖動，唯一的問題是他們是不是考創新生存的）。\n\n其次，甚至到現在，版權是否起作用也是值得懷疑的。音樂產業就是一個典型的例子。在不斷提高的通訊技朮下，音樂文件得到廣泛自由的傳播，但是應當從版權得到丰厚回報的藝朮家們，并沒有。版權讓中間人控制了發行機制，同時損害了藝朮家和公眾的利益。"

"Freenet has a different threat model to Tor and the Mixmaster remailers.\n"
"Freenet is designed to resist censorship: The network must therefore be\n"
"robust, and content must be distributed without requiring a central server,\n"
"whether anonymous or not. Anonymity is important for requesters and\n"
"especially for those who upload content in the first place. The typical\n"
"example is a corporate or government whistleblower. Generally to find the\n"
"originator of some content, the attacker must be able to predict the data in\n"
"advance, must be able to move across the network relatively quickly, and must\n"
"be able to perform the attack while the data is being inserted; after that,\n"
"it is distributed across the network and is much harder to trace, and the\n"
"originator may have left the network. However, if by chance or by\n"
"overwhelming force the attacker is connected to the whistleblower (or e.g.\n"
"seizes the computers of everyone on the network), he may be able to identify\n"
"this much more quickly. All of this is vastly more difficult on a darknet,\n"
"where everyone connects only to their friends, where it is very hard for an\n"
"attacker to find nodes, and where to connect to a given node he must social\n"
"engineer its operator! Freenet does support opennet mode (plug and play),\n"
"but darknet is far more secure, and far more difficult to block on a national\n"
"firewall.\n"
"\n"

"world where nodes can be operated safely, that the authors of controversial\n"
"content will be able to either host (hidden) web servers themselves or upload\n"
"it to other (hidden, but usually centralised) storage systems, and so on. And\n"
"Tor has a concept of a \"client\", which is somebody who uses the service\n"
"without providing any value to it; on Freenet, every node relays data for its\n"
"neighbours. Hence the attacks on Freenet are completely different to the\n"
"attacks on Tor. Both compromise to some degree to enable more or less\n"

"pass through will cache the information, lowering the load on the network. If\n"

"close in on one another in the network topology until they are \"neighbors\"\n"

"In other words, in order to harm Freenet with a flood you need to\n"
"consistently change your point of entry into the network and continually\n"
"insert and request new data, and you will still only increase the workload\n"
"for the network that is linear to your own. Given an immense will and\n"

"Documents initially made public by the Missouri police department\n"
"describe their efforts on tracking Freenet usage.  Using a simple\n"
"scheme, they claim a near zero false positive rate for\n"
"tracking the originator of a download.  While we applaud all public\n"
"documentation on attacks, we have to point out that the claimed\n"
"effectiveness of their attacks is based solely on flawed mathematics.\n"
"In reality, the false positive rate of their method is at least 83%,\n"
"and close to 100% in real world scenarios.\n"
"\n"
"The claimed effectiveness of their attack is based on a false\n"
"assumption about the distribution of the HTL of incoming requests.  HTL (Hops\n"
"to Live) is a number embedded in each request that is usually\n"
"decremented when the request is forwarded, starting at a value of 18\n"
"at the originator of the request, and serves to limit the number of\n"
"hops a request can survive on the network.  As a security precaution,\n"
"the HTL is decremented probabilistically on the first few hops.  In\n"
"their tracking efforts, the Missouri police department assumes that\n"
"when multiple requests for pieces of a file arrive from a single node,\n"
"and all these requests have HTL 18 with no requests at HTL 17 or 16,\n"
"this node must be the originator of the requests, with a false\n"
"positive probability decreasing with the number of requests received\n"
"from the node.  This would be true if whether the HTL is\n"
"decremented is decided per request, which has historically been the\n"
"case in the early days of Freenet.  The vulnerability they claim to\n"
"exploit was however addressed in 2008 (last touched in [this\n"
"commit][commithtl18]).  Whether the HTL is decremented is since\n"
"decided per connection, so any probability they claim using the\n"
"aforementioned method is false.\n"
"\n"
"For every connection there is a 50% chance that all the HTL 18 requests\n"
"(not only a single one, as would be the case with per-request\n"
"probabilistic decrementing) did not originate from the node from which\n"
"we received them but were forwarded one step. So for 10 connections\n"
"(the lowest number of peers Freenet uses), there are on average 5\n"
"other nodes whose HTL 18 requests are forwarded with HTL 18, so the\n"
"probability that a given HTL 18 request originated at the node from\n"
"which we received it is only about 17% (1 in 6). If the node has more\n"
"connections (close to 30 is common), this probability is even lower. And\n"
"this probability does not get higher when gathering more requests of\n"
"chunks from a specific file or a specific kind of files, because they\n"
"can reasonably all be forwarded from a different node — the one which\n"
"really sent them.\n"
"\n"
"The heterogenity of the network and routing with second-level\n"
"connections taken into account does not easily yield robust\n"
"statistical claims without knowing the peers of peers of the node\n"
"under investigation. Staying connected for a long time might allow for\n"
"distinguishing between the changing peers of the node and requests\n"
"originating at the node itself, but with significant cost.\n"
"\n"
"If the node which is tracked has friend-to-friend peers\n"
"(which unlike automatically added peers do not change regularly), even waiting\n"
"will not allow finding out with the described method whether HTL 18 requests came from the\n"
"node itself or from the peers connected over\n"
"friend-to-friend connections.\n"
"\n"
"For details, see [the code][codehtl18].\n"
"\n"
"This does not make it impossible to track Freenet users who use only\n"
"Opennet mode (connecting to strangers), since a network where nodes\n"
"connect to strangers is inherently susceptible to Sybil attacks,\n"
"where nodes of typical users are outnumbered by malicious, colluding nodes.\n"
"\n"
"The only way to defend against serious attacks is to *use Freenet in\n"
"Friend-to-Friend mode*, where the precondition to tracking a user is\n"
"social engineering to get the people to whom he/she is connected to\n"
"betray the user. The need to defend against this type of attack is\n"
"the reason why the core of Freenet was rewritten in 2007 to add this\n"
"Friend-to-Friend mode (called Darknet mode).\n"
"\n"
"However the method used by the Missouri police department is using\n"
"false statistics: despite its flaws, Freenet's Opennet is much harder to\n"
"track than they claim.\n"
"\n"
"The Freenet developers do not condemn these attacks. Police departments\n"
"try to use every legal venue to catch criminals. This is their job and\n"
"vocation, but any attack they find could also be used by oppressive\n"
"governments to suppress dissenting opinions, so we will work to fix attacks\n"
"as they come to light.\n"
"We expect law enforcement to get their math right, especially when using\n"
"it in court. If they can get a warrant with an 83% false positive\n"
"rate, that's a problem for lawmakers. If they falsely claim a 0% false\n"
"positive rate, that's eroding the trust of citizens in the legal\n"
"system.\n"
"\n"
"Additional information on this attack is available from the\n"
"[mailing list discussion][mlhtl18].\n"
"\n"
"The mission of the Freenet Project is to safeguard freedom of the\n"
"press by providing censorship resistant communication. This requires\n"
"protecting people against being targeted for what they write or\n"
"read. To achieve this, Freenet enables users to publish anonymous\n"
"websites and offers chat, forums, and file-sharing, as well as\n"
"confidential communication among friends and methods to leverage the\n"

"\n"
"Highlights:\n"
"\n"
"- Fix uploads stalling when using MAXIMUM physical security.\n"
"- Fix lots of \"setNativePriority(X) has failed!\", which was caused by a serious thread priority problem. This might fix nodes unexpectedly losing peers.\n"
"- Order alerts within a category by time: if you have lots of messages from darknet peers they will remain nicely sorted.\n"
"- There is now a [caching layer][caching] which should significantly reduce I/O load.\n"
"- Update WebOfTrust from build 15 to build 18. [Its][wot16] [changelogs][wot17] [are][wot18] separate, but the changes reduce CPU load. Incremental score recomputation requires roughly 3 percent of the time of full recomputation, and queuing trust lists to disk lowers thread usage.\n"

"The Freenet team is very happy to announce the stable release of Freenet 0.7.5 build 1468.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"<b>Important notes</b>: downgrading from build 1468 is not supported; if you want to go back to build 1467 without losing the upload and download queues, <b>before</b> upgrading, back-up the following files and directories: master.keys, persistent-temp-*/, and node.db4o (see https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Program_files ). Please note that running transfers will be restarted from scratch too. A reminder to those testing auto-update to 1468-pre4: please restore your auto-update key to the default. One way to do this is to stop Freenet, remove the \"node.updater.URI\" line from freenet.ini, and start Freenet again.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"In this release, the way Freenet stores data locally has changed drastically by no longer using the now-deprecated db4o object storage. It is replaced with the product of toad's summer of work - a custom on-disk format that is much more robust against corruption and more efficient.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Existing unfinished downloads and uploads will be imported to a new format, which requires restarting them from the beginning.</li>\n"
"<li>Space for downloads is now all allocated at the start, so machines very low on disk space may run out, which causes downloads to temporarily fail until more space is available.</li>\n"
"<li>CHKs will change due to metadata bugfixes.</li>\n"
"<li>Some unofficial plugins will need to be updated because of API changes. Sone already works, as do all official plugins.</li>\n"
"<li>The queue format changes should make it extremely rare to lose the entire queue: the impact of corruption will almost always be localized.</li>\n"
"<li>Multi-container / site uploads can now be persistent, making it more practical to upload large sites.</li>\n"
"<li>Passworded physical security is now much stronger. (Full-disk encryption is still preferable.)</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>The Windows installer now defaults to starting Freenet on login.</li>\n"
"<li>There is a <a href=\"https://github.com/freenet/wintray\">new Windows tray app</a> with some useful features that is included with new installations. If you are using the existing Windows tray app you can download the new one <a href=\"https://downloads.freenetproject.org/alpha/installer/FreenetTray.exe.build01468\">here</a>. No need to put it in a specific directory - it will try the default installation location and prompt if it can't find it.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>The list of download keys moved from downloads/listFetchKeys.txt to downloads/listKeys.txt.</li>\n"
"<li>A list of upload keys is now available at uploads/listKeys.txt</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Gantros' index is now in the default bookmarks. It uses the same software as Enzo's index, which is no longer updated.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>The obsolete and deprecated XMLLibrary and XMLSpider plugins are no longer officially supported. They will still load for those who have them added, but are no longer shown on the plugin page.</li>\n"
"<li>In the interests of releasing this build more quickly, the new version of FlogHelper does not support exporting and importing backups from the web UI. The old backup code did not work with the new Freenet version after removing db4o. People can instead back up \"plugins.floghelper.FlogHelper\" files in the plugin-data directory. These can be dropped into the directory after unloading FlogHelper to restore a backup.</li>\n"
"<li>ThawIndexBrowser works again. Thanks saces!</li>\n"

"\n"
"*   Add Hungarian Windows installer translation. Thanks drezzium!*   Allow hiding the Java version End Of Life alert. (I'm sorry for the excessive annoyingness. Still - please upgrade Java!)\n"
"*   Upgrades to the next version (that is, when running this build's upgrade code) should no longer get [stuck in an upgrade loop][url_bug3208].\n"

"*   Add more opennet seed nodes. Thanks saces and juiceman!\n"
"*   This build will be mandatory starting 2014-11-16, because old nodes will reject new nodes with more than 110 peers. Updates only take a few hours to spread, so this should only cause short term disruption.\n"

"According to [the press](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/alleged-tor-hidden-service-operator-busted-for-child-porn-distribution/), half of the hidden sites on Tor are now down, apparently connected to the arrest of a man allegedly behind Freedom Hosting, a hosting service for Tor hidden services. Some of these sites were said to offer illegal content and were apparently run by the FBI for two weeks, using a Javascript-based browser exploit to try to find their users.\n"
"\n"
"This has had no effect on Freenet and could not happen on Freenet. Tor hidden services are centralised: A hidden service on Tor is run by a single server somewhere, and if this server is found, the whole site can be shut down, or compromised. In this case half the hidden sites on Tor were run on the same group of servers! See the [Tor blog](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-current-events-and-freedom-hosting) and [mailing list](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2013-August/000089.html).\n"
"\n"
"On Freenet, anything you upload is distributed across the network across thousands of separate nodes all over the world, and will remain available for as long as it remains sufficiently popular: Freenet is a distributed data storage network designed to prevent censorship, provide anonymity and be hard to block. To see more information on the difference between Freenet and Tor, see [our explanation in the FAQ](https://freenetproject.org/faq.html#tor).\n"
"\n"
"Also, the Javascript exploit mentioned would not have worked on Freenet because Freenet removes Javascript by default. The Tor Browser Bundle has an option to block Javascript. We recommend that you enable this if you use Tor.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, there was no attack against Tor itself: As far as we know, no users of the major \"darknets\" (Freenet, Tor and I2P) has been traced by attacking the networks, by law enforcement or anyone else. In this case, it appears to have been user error, not a problem with Tor itself. Similarly on Freenet, users need to be careful, and Freenet will often tell you when you are about to do something risky.\n"
"\n"
"Having said that, Freenet's security is not perfect, and there are some known (but theoretical) weaknesses, so it might be possible for an attacker with relatively limited resources to trace individual Freenet contributors. Most of Freenet's weaknesses can be addressed by making long-lived connections with people that you trust, i.e. building a friend-to-friend \"darknet\". This functionality is already a part of the regular Freenet software, but we need more users who use Freenet in friend-to-friend mode to improve anonymity.\n"
"\n"
"We have planned further improvements, which should greatly improve security (censorship resistance, anonymity and resistance to blocking), speed and usability. The expanding online surveillance from both governments (e.g. PRISM) and private corporations clearly show that tools such as Freenet, TOR and I2P are essential for a healthy democracy.\n"
"\n"
"Please help us secure freedom of access to information by contributing to the Freenet-project with code, donations, translations, or just by running a node or creating content (anonymously)!\n"
"\n"
"Volunteers - especially developers - are always very welcome. Feel free to contact us, through [IRC online chat](help.html#irc), [the mailing lists](help.html#mailing-lists), or on Freenet itself in the \"freenet\" board on FMS.\n"

Nonetheless, we are working on improvements to both make this attack harder and to solve some of the [other known attacks](https://freenetproject.org/faq.html#attack).

That means, get your friends using Freenet, and then add them as Friends on your node. When enough people use Freenet and form darknet connections, we won't need opennet, and this makes all attacks dramatically harder. We will work on making this easier and faster in the near future, as well as fixing the Pitch Black attack."
