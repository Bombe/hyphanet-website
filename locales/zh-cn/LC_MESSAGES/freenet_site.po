"### 6\\. Isn't censorship sometimes necessary?\n"
"\n"
"Of course no issue is black and white, and there are many who feel that\n"
"censorship is a good thing in some circumstances. For example, in some\n"
"European countries propagating information deemed to be racist is illegal.\n"
"Governments seek to prevent people from advocating ideas which are deemed\n"
"damaging to society. There are two answers to this however. The first is that\n"
"you can't allow those in power to impose \"good\" censorship, without also\n"
"enabling them to impose \"bad\" censorship. To impose any form of censorship a\n"
"government must have the ability to monitor and thus restrict communication.\n"
"There are already criticisms that the anti-racism censorship in many European\n"
"countries is hampering legitimate historical analysis of events such as the\n"
"second world war.\n"
"\n"
"The second argument is that this \"good\" censorship is counter-productive even\n"
"when it does not leak into other areas. For example, it is generally more\n"
"effective when trying to persuade someone of something to present them with\n"
"the arguments against it, and then answer those arguments. Unfortunately,\n"
"preventing people from being aware of the often sophisticated arguments used\n"
"by racists, makes them vulnerable to those arguments when they do eventually\n"
"encounter them.\n"
"\n"
"Of course the first argument is the stronger one, and would still hold-true\n"
"even if you didn't accept the second. Basically, you either have censorship,\n"
"or you don't. There is no middle-ground."
msgstr "### 6\\. 有时审查制度不是必须的吗？\n\n所有问题都不是非黑即白的，很多人都认为在某些情况下审查制度是个好东西。例如，在某些欧洲国家，传播种族主义信息是违法的。政府寻求阻止此思想的宣扬，以免破坏社会。但对此行为有两种争论。首先，您不能确保当权者实施“好的”审查制度，而不实施“坏的”审查制度。要实施任何形式的审查制度，政府一定拥有监视和限制沟通的权力。在很多欧洲国家已经有对种族主义审查制度的批评，它阻止了合理的对历史事件的分析（如第二次世界大战）。\n\n第二种争论是，即使“好的”审查制度没有渗入其他领域，它仍然会起到反作用。例如，通常来说，将争议摆在桌面，回答这些争议，更容易说服某人。不幸的是，虽然阻止了人们了解种族主义分子的争议，但当他们最终遇到这些争论时，他们会变得更加脆弱。\n\n当然第一种争论是最强的，即使您不接受第二种争论，它也是正确的。根本上，要么存在审查制度，要么不存在。不存在中间的情况。"

"### 7\\. But why is anonymity necessary?\n"
"\n"
"You cannot have freedom of speech without the option to remain anonymous.\n"
"Most censorship is retrospective, it is generally much easier to curtail free\n"
"speech by punishing those who exercise it afterward, rather than preventing\n"
"them from doing it in the first place. The only way to prevent this is to\n"
"remain anonymous. It is a common misconception that you cannot trust\n"
"anonymous information. This is not necessarily true, using digital signatures\n"
"people can create a secure anonymous pseudonym which, in time, people can\n"
"learn to trust. Freenet incorporates a mechanism called \"subspaces\" to\n"
"facilitate this."
msgstr "### 7\\. 但是为何需要匿名？\n\n如果您无法匿名，您不可能拥有言论自由。大部分的审查是可追溯的。在发表言论后再惩罚相关人员，比在言论发表第一时间处理更容易。唯一可避免惩罚的方式就是保持匿名。有一个常见的误解是，匿名信息不可信。这不一定是正确的。使用数字签名，人们可以创建一个安全的笔名，他人可以去信任这个笔名。Freenet 引入了“子空间（Subspaces）”的机制来使之成为可能。"

"### 8\\. And what of copyright?\n"
"\n"
"Of course much of Freenet's publicity has centered around the issue of\n"
"copyright, and thus I will speak to it briefly. The core problem with\n"
"copyright is that enforcement of it requires monitoring of communications,\n"
"and you cannot be guaranteed free speech if someone is monitoring everything\n"
"you say. This is important, most people fail to see or address this point\n"
"when debating the issue of copyright, so let me make it clear:\n"
"\n"
"> *You cannot guarantee freedom of speech and enforce copyright law*\n"
"\n"
"It is for this reason that Freenet, a system designed to protect Freedom of\n"
"Speech, must prevent enforcement of copyright."
msgstr "### 8\\. 版权又将怎样？\n\nFreenet 的很多媒体报道都关注它带来的版权问题，因此我在这里简单说一下。版权的核心问题在于，为了保护版权，就需要监视通讯。如果某人监视了您所说的一切，您的言论自由就无法保障。这非常重要，在人们争论保护版权的问题时，往往忽略了这一点。因此，我再次强调：\n\n> *您无法在保证言论自由的同时实施版权法*\n\n这就是 Freenet——一个被设计为保护言论自由的系统——拒绝保护版权的原因。"

"### 9\\. But how will artists be rewarded for their work without copyright?\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, even if copyright were the only way that artists could be rewarded\n"
"for their work, then I would contend that freedom is more important than\n"
"having professional artists (those who claim that we would have no art do not\n"
"understand creativity: people will always create, it is a compulsion,\n"
"the only question is whether they can do it for a living).\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, it could be questioned whether copyright is effective even now. The\n"
"music industry is one of the most vocally opposed to enhancements in\n"
"communication technology, yet according to many of the artists who should be\n"
"rewarded by copyright, it is failing to do so. Rather it has allowed\n"
"middle-men to gain control over the mechanisms of distribution, to the\n"
"detriment of both artists and the public."
msgstr "### 9\\. 但若艺术家的工作没有版权，他们如何得到回报？\n\n首先，即使版权是艺术家从其作品获得回报的唯一方式，我主张自由比拥有专业艺术家更重要（那些声称我们没有艺术细胞不懂得创新的人：人们总是在创新，这是种冲动，唯一的问题是他们是不是考创新生存的）。\n\n其次，甚至到现在，版权是否起作用也是值得怀疑的。音乐产业就是一个典型的例子。在不断提高的通讯技术下，音乐文件得到广泛自由的传播，但是应当从版权得到丰厚回报的艺术家们，并没有。版权让中间人控制了发行机制，同时损害了艺术家和公众的利益。"

"\n"
"Fortunately it won't come to this. There are many alternative ways to reward\n"
"artists. The simplest is voluntary payment. This is an extension of the\n"
"patronage system which was frequently used to reward artists prior to\n"
"copyright, where a wealthy person would fund an artist to allow them to\n"
"create full-time. The Internet permits an interesting extension of this idea,\n"

"thousands, contributing small amounts of money over the Internet.\n"

"Freenet has a different threat model to Tor and the Mixmaster remailers.\n"
"Freenet is designed to resist censorship: The network must therefore be\n"
"robust, and content must be distributed without requiring a central server,\n"
"whether anonymous or not. Anonymity is important for requesters and\n"
"especially for those who upload content in the first place. The typical\n"
"example is a corporate or government whistleblower. Generally to find the\n"
"originator of some content, the attacker must be able to predict the data in\n"
"advance, must be able to move across the network relatively quickly, and must\n"
"be able to perform the attack while the data is being inserted; after that,\n"
"it is distributed across the network and is much harder to trace, and the\n"
"originator may have left the network. However, if by chance or by\n"
"overwhelming force the attacker is connected to the whistleblower (or e.g.\n"
"seizes the computers of everyone on the network), he may be able to identify\n"
"this much more quickly. All of this is vastly more difficult on a darknet,\n"
"where everyone connects only to their friends, where it is very hard for an\n"
"attacker to find nodes, and where to connect to a given node he must social\n"
"engineer its operator! Freenet does support opennet mode (plug and play),\n"
"but darknet is far more secure, and far more difficult to block on a national\n"
"firewall.\n"
"\n"
"Tor on the other hand is designed to anonymise real-time data streams,\n"
"on the assumption that the list of nodes can be public, that there is a free\n"
"world where nodes can be operated safely, that the authors of controversial\n"
"content will be able to either host (hidden) web servers themselves or upload\n"
"it to other (hidden, but usually centralised) storage systems, and so on. And\n"
"Tor has a concept of a \"client\", which is somebody who uses the service\n"
"without providing any value to it; on Freenet, every node relays data for its\n"
"neighbours. Hence the attacks on Freenet are completely different to the\n"
"attacks on Tor. Both compromise to some degree to enable more or less\n"

"\n"
"We don't think so. Aside from protecting freedom of speech, Freenet is also\n"
"designed to be an efficient dynamic caching system. If information is\n"
"requested a lot from a limited number of nodes, the nodes that the requests\n"
"pass through will cache the information, lowering the load on the network. If\n"
"information is inserted on a limited set of nodes and then subsequently\n"
"requested a lot from a separate set of nodes, with repetition, the sets will\n"
"close in on one another in the network topology until they are \"neighbors\"\n"
"and only the originally targeted nodes are suffering from the attack.\n"
"\n"
"In other words, in order to harm Freenet with a flood you need to\n"
"consistently change your point of entry into the network and continually\n"
"insert and request new data, and you will still only increase the workload\n"
"for the network that is linear to your own. Given an immense will and\n"
"capacity greater than the total of the entire network, it is possible to\n"
"cripple any public network (including the Internet itself) with floods,\n"

"theoretically possible.\n"

"Curiously enough, the above analysis only applies to [Opennet](\n"
"https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Opennet). On Darknet, you might have a little\n"
"more success, although it would be much harder to change your entry point in\n"
"any significant way. Nonetheless, you have a reasonably low bandwidth\n"

"Documents initially made public by the Missouri police department\n"
"describe their efforts on tracking Freenet usage.  Using a simple\n"
"scheme, they claim a near zero false positive rate for\n"
"tracking the originator of a download.  While we applaud all public\n"
"documentation on attacks, we have to point out that the claimed\n"
"effectiveness of their attacks is based solely on flawed mathematics.\n"
"In reality, the false positive rate of their method is at least 83%,\n"
"and close to 100% in real world scenarios.\n"
"\n"
"The claimed effectiveness of their attack is based on a false\n"
"assumption about the distribution of the HTL of incoming requests.  HTL (Hops\n"
"to Live) is a number embedded in each request that is usually\n"
"decremented when the request is forwarded, starting at a value of 18\n"
"at the originator of the request, and serves to limit the number of\n"
"hops a request can survive on the network.  As a security precaution,\n"
"the HTL is decremented probabilistically on the first few hops.  In\n"
"their tracking efforts, the Missouri police department assumes that\n"
"when multiple requests for pieces of a file arrive from a single node,\n"
"and all these requests have HTL 18 with no requests at HTL 17 or 16,\n"
"this node must be the originator of the requests, with a false\n"
"positive probability decreasing with the number of requests received\n"
"from the node.  This would be true if whether the HTL is\n"
"decremented is decided per request, which has historically been the\n"
"case in the early days of Freenet.  The vulnerability they claim to\n"
"exploit was however addressed in 2008 (last touched in [this\n"
"commit][commithtl18]).  Whether the HTL is decremented is since\n"
"decided per connection, so any probability they claim using the\n"
"aforementioned method is false.\n"
"\n"
"For every connection there is a 50% chance that all the HTL 18 requests\n"
"(not only a single one, as would be the case with per-request\n"
"probabilistic decrementing) did not originate from the node from which\n"
"we received them but were forwarded one step. So for 10 connections\n"
"(the lowest number of peers Freenet uses), there are on average 5\n"
"other nodes whose HTL 18 requests are forwarded with HTL 18, so the\n"
"probability that a given HTL 18 request originated at the node from\n"
"which we received it is only about 17% (1 in 6). If the node has more\n"
"connections (close to 30 is common), this probability is even lower. And\n"
"this probability does not get higher when gathering more requests of\n"
"chunks from a specific file or a specific kind of files, because they\n"
"can reasonably all be forwarded from a different node — the one which\n"
"really sent them.\n"
"\n"
"The heterogenity of the network and routing with second-level\n"
"connections taken into account does not easily yield robust\n"
"statistical claims without knowing the peers of peers of the node\n"
"under investigation. Staying connected for a long time might allow for\n"
"distinguishing between the changing peers of the node and requests\n"
"originating at the node itself, but with significant cost.\n"
"\n"
"If the node which is tracked has friend-to-friend peers\n"
"(which unlike automatically added peers do not change regularly), even waiting\n"
"will not allow finding out with the described method whether HTL 18 requests came from the\n"
"node itself or from the peers connected over\n"
"friend-to-friend connections.\n"
"\n"
"For details, see [the code][codehtl18].\n"
"\n"
"This does not make it impossible to track Freenet users who use only\n"
"Opennet mode (connecting to strangers), since a network where nodes\n"
"connect to strangers is inherently susceptible to Sybil attacks,\n"
"where nodes of typical users are outnumbered by malicious, colluding nodes.\n"
"\n"
"The only way to defend against serious attacks is to *use Freenet in\n"
"Friend-to-Friend mode*, where the precondition to tracking a user is\n"
"social engineering to get the people to whom he/she is connected to\n"
"betray the user. The need to defend against this type of attack is\n"
"the reason why the core of Freenet was rewritten in 2007 to add this\n"
"Friend-to-Friend mode (called Darknet mode).\n"
"\n"
"However the method used by the Missouri police department is using\n"
"false statistics: despite its flaws, Freenet's Opennet is much harder to\n"
"track than they claim.\n"
"\n"
"The Freenet developers do not condemn these attacks. Police departments\n"
"try to use every legal venue to catch criminals. This is their job and\n"
"vocation, but any attack they find could also be used by oppressive\n"
"governments to suppress dissenting opinions, so we will work to fix attacks\n"
"as they come to light.\n"
"We expect law enforcement to get their math right, especially when using\n"
"it in court. If they can get a warrant with an 83% false positive\n"
"rate, that's a problem for lawmakers. If they falsely claim a 0% false\n"
"positive rate, that's eroding the trust of citizens in the legal\n"
"system.\n"
"\n"
"Additional information on this attack is available from the\n"
"[mailing list discussion][mlhtl18].\n"
"\n"
"The mission of the Freenet Project is to safeguard freedom of the\n"
"press by providing censorship resistant communication. This requires\n"
"protecting people against being targeted for what they write or\n"
"read. To achieve this, Freenet enables users to publish anonymous\n"
"websites and offers chat, forums, and file-sharing, as well as\n"
"confidential communication among friends and methods to leverage the\n"
"capabilities of Freenet from other tools.\n"
"\n"
"When the police spread misinformation about the security of Freenet, it\n"

"- New version of KeyUtils.\n"

"The Freenet team is very happy to announce the stable release of Freenet 0.7.5 build 1468.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"<b>Important notes</b>: downgrading from build 1468 is not supported; if you want to go back to build 1467 without losing the upload and download queues, <b>before</b> upgrading, back-up the following files and directories: master.keys, persistent-temp-*/, and node.db4o (see https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Program_files ). Please note that running transfers will be restarted from scratch too. A reminder to those testing auto-update to 1468-pre4: please restore your auto-update key to the default. One way to do this is to stop Freenet, remove the \"node.updater.URI\" line from freenet.ini, and start Freenet again.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"In this release, the way Freenet stores data locally has changed drastically by no longer using the now-deprecated db4o object storage. It is replaced with the product of toad's summer of work - a custom on-disk format that is much more robust against corruption and more efficient.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Existing unfinished downloads and uploads will be imported to a new format, which requires restarting them from the beginning.</li>\n"
"<li>Space for downloads is now all allocated at the start, so machines very low on disk space may run out, which causes downloads to temporarily fail until more space is available.</li>\n"
"<li>CHKs will change due to metadata bugfixes.</li>\n"
"<li>Some unofficial plugins will need to be updated because of API changes. Sone already works, as do all official plugins.</li>\n"
"<li>The queue format changes should make it extremely rare to lose the entire queue: the impact of corruption will almost always be localized.</li>\n"
"<li>Multi-container / site uploads can now be persistent, making it more practical to upload large sites.</li>\n"
"<li>Passworded physical security is now much stronger. (Full-disk encryption is still preferable.)</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>The Windows installer now defaults to starting Freenet on login.</li>\n"
"<li>There is a <a href=\"https://github.com/freenet/wintray\">new Windows tray app</a> with some useful features that is included with new installations. If you are using the existing Windows tray app you can download the new one <a href=\"https://downloads.freenetproject.org/alpha/installer/FreenetTray.exe.build01468\">here</a>. No need to put it in a specific directory - it will try the default installation location and prompt if it can't find it.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>The list of download keys moved from downloads/listFetchKeys.txt to downloads/listKeys.txt.</li>\n"
"<li>A list of upload keys is now available at uploads/listKeys.txt</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Gantros' index is now in the default bookmarks. It uses the same software as Enzo's index, which is no longer updated.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>The obsolete and deprecated XMLLibrary and XMLSpider plugins are no longer officially supported. They will still load for those who have them added, but are no longer shown on the plugin page.</li>\n"
"<li>In the interests of releasing this build more quickly, the new version of FlogHelper does not support exporting and importing backups from the web UI. The old backup code did not work with the new Freenet version after removing db4o. People can instead back up \"plugins.floghelper.FlogHelper\" files in the plugin-data directory. These can be dropped into the directory after unloading FlogHelper to restore a backup.</li>\n"
"<li>ThawIndexBrowser works again. Thanks saces!</li>\n"

"\n"
"Key Points:\n"
"\n"
"*   use Freenet to distribute online updates\n"
"*   most secure hosting option\n"
"\n"
"That means it is now possible to get reproducibly built kernels checked by anonymous (and therefore hard to pressure) contributors and update them over Freenet without disclosing that you use them. This applies to the packages provided by Mempo - other apt-get activity like installing GIMP is still public. It would be possible to host the entire Debian repository in Freenet, but this is not yet on the agenda for Mempo because this other activity does not disclose the potentially sensitive information that you want additional privacy.\n"
"\n"
"> The practical cool result now, is that Mempo repository can not be censored, DDoSed or taken offline, despite having just 1 tiny server (or no server at all) - rfreeman (one of the mempo developers)"

"This release is planned to be the second-to-last version of Freenet to support Java 6\\. The version after this one will refuse to upgrade unless running on Java 7 or later. Support for this behavior is part of a larger effort to allow separate official update channels - stable, testing, and unstable - as well as make it easier to publish unofficial update channels and further improve deployment security.\n"
"\n"
"Highlights for this build:\n"
"\n"
"*   Add Hungarian Windows installer translation. Thanks drezzium!*   Allow hiding the Java version End Of Life alert. (I'm sorry for the excessive annoyingness. Still - please upgrade Java!)\n"
"*   Upgrades to the next version (that is, when running this build's upgrade code) should no longer get [stuck in an upgrade loop][url_bug3208].\n"
"*   Increase opennet peer limit to 142 peers. This now has [more math behind it][url_peermath] and will change when network parameters are adjusted.\n"
"*   Add more opennet seed nodes. Thanks saces and juiceman!\n"
"*   This build will be mandatory starting 2014-11-16, because old nodes will reject new nodes with more than 110 peers. Updates only take a few hours to spread, so this should only cause short term disruption.\n"
"\n"
"Additionally Matthew's (toad_'s) summer work on a custom on-disk format is done. This release lays the groundwork to include the results of that work [in the next release][url_toad]. This is designed for less disk activity and better behavior when corrupted.\n"
"\n"
"This release coincides with the 25th anniversary of the demolition of the Berlin wall (Mauerfall), which marked the beginning of the end of a large censorship and surveillance regime. May censorship be demolished everywhere!\n"

"According to [the press](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/alleged-tor-hidden-service-operator-busted-for-child-porn-distribution/), half of the hidden sites on Tor are now down, apparently connected to the arrest of a man allegedly behind Freedom Hosting, a hosting service for Tor hidden services. Some of these sites were said to offer illegal content and were apparently run by the FBI for two weeks, using a Javascript-based browser exploit to try to find their users.\n"
"\n"
"This has had no effect on Freenet and could not happen on Freenet. Tor hidden services are centralised: A hidden service on Tor is run by a single server somewhere, and if this server is found, the whole site can be shut down, or compromised. In this case half the hidden sites on Tor were run on the same group of servers! See the [Tor blog](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-current-events-and-freedom-hosting) and [mailing list](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2013-August/000089.html).\n"
"\n"
"On Freenet, anything you upload is distributed across the network across thousands of separate nodes all over the world, and will remain available for as long as it remains sufficiently popular: Freenet is a distributed data storage network designed to prevent censorship, provide anonymity and be hard to block. To see more information on the difference between Freenet and Tor, see [our explanation in the FAQ](https://freenetproject.org/faq.html#tor).\n"
"\n"
"Also, the Javascript exploit mentioned would not have worked on Freenet because Freenet removes Javascript by default. The Tor Browser Bundle has an option to block Javascript. We recommend that you enable this if you use Tor.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, there was no attack against Tor itself: As far as we know, no users of the major \"darknets\" (Freenet, Tor and I2P) has been traced by attacking the networks, by law enforcement or anyone else. In this case, it appears to have been user error, not a problem with Tor itself. Similarly on Freenet, users need to be careful, and Freenet will often tell you when you are about to do something risky.\n"
"\n"
"Having said that, Freenet's security is not perfect, and there are some known (but theoretical) weaknesses, so it might be possible for an attacker with relatively limited resources to trace individual Freenet contributors. Most of Freenet's weaknesses can be addressed by making long-lived connections with people that you trust, i.e. building a friend-to-friend \"darknet\". This functionality is already a part of the regular Freenet software, but we need more users who use Freenet in friend-to-friend mode to improve anonymity.\n"
"\n"
"We have planned further improvements, which should greatly improve security (censorship resistance, anonymity and resistance to blocking), speed and usability. The expanding online surveillance from both governments (e.g. PRISM) and private corporations clearly show that tools such as Freenet, TOR and I2P are essential for a healthy democracy.\n"
"\n"
"Please help us secure freedom of access to information by contributing to the Freenet-project with code, donations, translations, or just by running a node or creating content (anonymously)!\n"
"\n"
"Volunteers - especially developers - are always very welcome. Feel free to contact us, through [IRC online chat](help.html#irc), [the mailing lists](help.html#mailing-lists), or on Freenet itself in the \"freenet\" board on FMS.\n"

"*   **Freemail**, a private and untraceable email over Freenet system.\n"

"xor is well qualified for the role as he wrote most of the current code in the Web of Trust. The immediate priority will be to improve stability and performance by implementing a new more efficient FCP API. After that further optimisations are planned.\n"

"Some academics [have published](http://www.ee.hawaii.edu/~dong/traceback/index.htm) a couple of attacks against Freenet, and they appear to be working on more as part of a project to unmask anonymous Freenet users. Build 1411, which was released on the 3rd of September, makes their main attack largely impractical. Nonetheless, we are working on improvements to both make this attack harder and to solve some of the [other known attacks](https://freenetproject.org/faq.html#attack). You can learn more about the attacks and our solution to them on our chief developer's [personal blog](http://amphibian.dyndns.org/flogmirror/#20120911-security).\n"
"\n"
"We welcome all work to understand Freenet's security and expose any problems with it, although we would suggest that next time they might let us know before they make the paper public, as is common practice in the security community.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, the long term solution is to build a darknet, a Freenet network where people only connect directly to people they trust. That means, get your friends using Freenet, and then add them as Friends on your node. When enough people use Freenet and form darknet connections, we won't need opennet, and this makes all attacks dramatically harder. We will work on making this easier and faster in the near future, as well as fixing the Pitch Black attack."
