In early 2023, the board of Freenet Project, Inc - the nonprofit that started
work in 1999 - decided to rename its new project Locutus to "Freenet." This
required that Freenet change its name. Locutus began development in 2019, and
has different design priorities. Freenet began development in 1999.

As part of the renaming process, following community suggestions and voting, we
chose the name Hyphanet after a [mycorrhizal network][wiki]. Hyphae join with
plant roots to form connections between fungi, and allow underground
communication between trees in a forest.

We've done our best to ensure that old links still work, and that images and
whatnot aren't broken after applying the name change to this website, but if we
missed something, please [let us know][chat]!

For more information, see the [mailing list announcement thread][devl-thread].
