In early 2023, the board of The Freenet Project, Inc. decided to concentrate on a
[new software project](https://freenet.org/), initially named Locutus.
Freenet has been renamed to Hyphanet and spun out into this separate project
under its existing development team.

As part of the renaming process, after community suggestions and voting, we
chose the name Hyphanet after a [mycorrhizal network][wiki]. Hyphae join with
plant roots to form connections between fungi, and allow underground
communication between trees in a forest.

We've done our best to ensure that old links still work, and that images and
whatnot aren't broken after applying the name change to this website, but if we
missed something, please [let us know][chat]!

For more information, see the [Locutus FAQ][faq] or the [mailing list
announcement][devl-thread].
