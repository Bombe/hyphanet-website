In early 2023, the board of Freenet Project, Inc - the nonprofit that started Freenet in 1999 - decided to rename its Locutus project to Freenet. This required that Freenet change its name. Locutus began development in 2019, and has different design priorities.

We've done our best to ensure that old links still work
and images and whatnot aren't broken after applying the
change to this website, but if we missed something,
please [let us know](irc.html)!
